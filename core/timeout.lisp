Different types of objects may implement different timing schemes
involving either real-time or simulated real-time.  If the obj
argument is NULL, the callback is associated with a global \"timer
manager\" object which uses the default timing algorithm.

With the default (real-time) timing algorithm, a \"tick\" is
considered equivalent to roughly 1 millisecond.  Different timing
schemes can assign different meanings to a \"tick\".  The AG_Timeout
