This is a CommonLisp library intended to make Agar (http://libagar.org) usable in CommonLisp.

Special notes on this branch:
simple-editable
---------------

This branch is a branch of experimental.
This branch's code is not supposed to work and to be used in other
projects.  It is basically a place for sketches and 'code design
studies'.

It tries to have AG_Editable defined only as a simple foreign type,
i. e. no wrapper objects are created.
